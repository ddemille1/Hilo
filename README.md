# HiLo
A guessing game is always exciting! Why not test your luck at HiLo and see how far you can go? 300 points are given to you to start the game. A first card value is drawn randomly for you. Then you continue by answering yes or no to the question if you want to keep playing. Guess if the value of the next card is higher or lower than the previous one. If you get the answer right, you will be awarded 100 points. If you are wrong, you loose 75 points. If you choose to end the game, answer no. Be careful! If your points reach 0, the game is over.
